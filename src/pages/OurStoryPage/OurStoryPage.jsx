            With so many dating apps out there, you’d think finding someone real
            would be easier. Instead, most of them want you to swipe endlessly,
            hoping that maybe the next match will finally end the single trail.
            Almost every app focuses on looks and interests, but none focus on
            you. Who you are. What you stand for. Your culture. Your background.
            It’s not just about religion or language, it’s deeper than that.
            It’s about finding someone who shares what makes you, you! Someone
            who understands the way you were raised, the values you carry, and
            the small details that mean everything. Galbi wasn’t created to
            chase profit or trends. As long as it runs, it runs for a purpose,
            to help people find real, honest relationships, the traditional way.
            This isn’t another app trying to keep you hooked. It’s a home for
            people who still believe love should be intentional, respectful, and
            rooted in meaning. Because in a world moving too fast, we choose
            love that remembers where it came from.
